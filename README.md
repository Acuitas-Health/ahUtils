# Acuitas Utilities Package

A collection of convenience packages for Acuitas employees. Probably not useful if you don't work for Acuitas Health. You can install this package with: `remotes::install_github("acuitas-health/ahUtils")` from within R. Or, if you have cloned this repo, you can install via make using `make install`.

Either way, you should install this via GitHub or it will not work on RStudio Connect.
